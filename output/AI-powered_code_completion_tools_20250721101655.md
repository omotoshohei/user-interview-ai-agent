3. Key Qualitative Insights  

Theme: Contextual Understanding & Accuracy  
- Experienced engineer (Sato) highlights the need for AI to deeply understand project-specific contexts such as coding conventions, architecture patterns, and long-term codebase history to reduce manual corrections.  
- “The biggest challenge is the depth and accuracy of context understanding… proposals often miss team-specific rules, causing extra work.”  

Theme: Customization to Team/Project Standards  
- Sato desires enhanced customization so AI suggestions automatically conform to team coding standards, reducing review overhead.  
- Beginner user (Yamamoto) also values the ability to adjust AI behavior to personal or project styles for better usability.  

Theme: Ease of Onboarding & Learning Support  
- Yamamoto, a beginner in code completion tools, stresses the importance of clear tutorials, progressive guides, and example-driven explanations to build confidence.  
- “Step-by-step tutorials and real code examples would help me understand and use the tool effectively.”  

Theme: Error Detection & Quality Feedback  
- Both Sato and Yamamoto want AI not only to generate code but also to provide quality assessments, refactoring suggestions, and real-time error detection to improve code quality.  
- “A feature that flags potential bugs or non-optimal code would be very helpful.”  

Theme: Integration & Multi-language Support  
- Yamamoto notes the need for multi-language support and smooth integration with popular IDEs like VSCode and PyCharm to fit diverse workflows.  

Theme: Privacy & Security  
- Yamamoto emphasizes clear communication about data handling and code privacy to build trust in the tool.  

Theme: Community & Support  
- Yamamoto values accessible support channels such as forums, FAQs, and chat to resolve issues quickly.  

4. Example Personas
